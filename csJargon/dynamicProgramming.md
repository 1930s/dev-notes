# Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming is a way to break down optimization problems into simpler sub-problems, and storing their result so they are solved only once.
*To always remember answers to sub-problems you've already solved.*

One algorithm for dynamic programming is **memoization**.

### Top down dynamic programming:

Start with the large, complex problem and break it down into smaller sub-problems, memoizing the problem into parts.

### Bottom up dynamic programming:

Starts with the smallest possible subproblem, figures out a solution to them and then slowly builds itself up to solve larger, more complicated subproblems.
