# REPL

**Read-Eval-Print-Loop** or `REPL` is an interactive computer programming environment that takes a user input, reads it, evaluates it, returns a result to the user.

Command line shells are examples of REPL.

```
$ node
```

```
$ node
>
```

```
$ node
> 1 + 3
4
```

Online REPLs are also available, such as [Immutable.js](http://neilff.github.io/immutable-repl/?q=Y29uc3QgbGlzdCA9IEltbXV0YWJsZS5MaXN0KFsxLCAyLCAzXSk7CgpsaXN0Lm1hcChpID0%2BIGkgKiAzMCk7) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/)
