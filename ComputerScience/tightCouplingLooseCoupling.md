# Tight coupling vs loose coupling.

**Tight coupling** is when a group of classes are very **dependent** on each other. It rises when one class assumes too many responsibilities or when one concern is spread over many classes rather than having its own class.

**Loose coupling** is an approach to connecting different components in a system so that they **depend on each other the least** extend practicable.
Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another.
