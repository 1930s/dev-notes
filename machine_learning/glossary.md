# Glossary

* Accuracy: Number of points classified correctly / total number of points on the scatter plot.

* **Linear decision surface**: In a scatter plot graph, sets of data (**classes**) can be separated in difference decision surfaces by a **decision boundary**. If this decision boundary is a **straight line**, it is called a **Linear Decision Surface**.

* If using very large data sets, Naive Bayes is better than SVM.
