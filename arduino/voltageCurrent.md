# Difference between voltage and current

Voltage is given by your battery, current is taken by your circuit from the battery.

An Arduino Uno can take between 3.5V to 5V so anything outside of this range is not good to use with it.

However, an Arduino Nano can take between 7V and 12V so a 9V battery can be used with it.
