# Some Prototyping Vocabulary

Lately, I have been working on a project that is pushing me to go a bit further in my prototyping. I am actually building something that requires me to solder more components and create my own prototyping board.

Here's a bit of vocabulary I learnt:

* **Perfboard or Protoboard**: A step further from the breadboard, this type of board is a thin, rigid sheet with holes pre-drilled into it. These holes are ringed by round or square copper pads.

* **Breakout board**: Takes a component and makes it easy to use. It usually is an integrated circuit with pins on it. There are different types of breakout boards for sensors like accelerometer, distance sensor, temperature sensor, etc...

* **Headers**: Headers are these pieces of metal that you can solder to the pins of a breakout board to make it stackable or to make it easier to solder on a perfboard or use on a breadboard.
