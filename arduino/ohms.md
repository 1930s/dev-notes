# Ohms

Electrical resistance is measured in **ohms**.
The Greek omega symbol (Ω) is used to indicate ohms.
Letter K (or alternatively, KΩ) means a kilohm, which is 1,000 ohms.

A material that has a high resistance to electricity is called an *insulator*.
* Example: plastic.

A material that has a low resistance to electricity is called a *conductor*.
* Example: Aluminium.
