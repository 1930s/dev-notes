# Direct and alternating current

The flow of current going through a battery is known as *direct current*, or **DC**. It is like a steady stream, going in one direction.

The flow of current from a "hot" wire in a power outlet is different. It changes from positive to negative about 50 times a second. It is known as *alternating current*, or **AC**.
