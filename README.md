# TIL (Today I Learnt)

Inspired by @jbranchaud's [repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who stole the idea from @thoughtbot's [repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)

This project is a collection of small things I learn about different languages, frameworks or/and technologies.
It consists of short markdown documents summarizing concepts or tips I'd like to share.
The goal is to write something new everyday or as often as possible.

Currently: 3 TILs
