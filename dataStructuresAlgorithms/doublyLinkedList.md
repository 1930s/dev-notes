# Doubly linked list

A bit similar to a singly linked list, a doubly linked list is a linked list made of nodes, except that the
nodes contain a third field with a link to the previous node as well as the next node.

The advantage of a doubly linked list is that we can traverse back to the previous node for deletion for example.
