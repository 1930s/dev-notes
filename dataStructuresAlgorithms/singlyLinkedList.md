# Singly-linked list

A singly linked list is a data structure that can store an indefinite amount of items. These items are connected using pointers in a sequential manner.

In a singly-linked list, every element contains some data and a link to the next element.

The elements of a linked list are called **nodes**.


A node has 2 fields: **data** and **next**.

* The data field contains the data being stored in that specific node.

* The next node contains the address of the next node.

The very first node in a linked list is called **head** and the last is called **tail**.
